    // having static block because static runs first, because in this clas we dont have Main method or TestNg to run the class so we will need a "Static block" (which will run one time when we call the class no matter what )

    // try and catch will handle it but throws will just ignore it so it might be better just to handle it , Remember Saim said if you just throw you need to keep doing that everytime you need to call this method .


    /*
    Shina so first thing first the methods we were trying to implement are implementing the Exception Interface  that are the checked exceptions, this ones you have to handle before running the code, so you have 2 options to add throws to signature block or to use try catch, we cant do first here there is no method signature its just a static block that will run every time before any other methods will . so we have to handle  it in the try catch block.
please donâ€™t  confuse 2 different  things throw and throws . first will create an object of exception and stop your codes execution , second added in the method signature will help the code to compile if you are using any methods that implement  the checked Exceptions
